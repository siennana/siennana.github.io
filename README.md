## Hello

![siennacodes](./public/assets/images/preview.png)

Thanks for checking out my portfolio. The website was designed using React and Typescript.
It's designed to look like a desktop. Using the icons you'll find:

* some of my artwork
* a music player with my top spotify tracks pulled with the Spotify API
* my projects
* a terminal emulator with some custom commands that I have implemented

# Welcome
This is my portfolio website. It's meant to look and feel just like a desktop environment. With the folder icons
you'll find some samples of my artwork, information about some of my coding projects and resume, and music that I listen to.  

The top bar contains links to my Github, LinkedIn, Spotify, and a mailto link for quick communication. Click around and see what you find!

# Welcome
This is my portfolio website. It's meant to look and feel just like a custom desktop environment. With the icons on the left
you'll find some samples of my artwork, details on some of my coding projects and resume, and music that I listen to.  

This site is a work in progress, so not everything works or is totally polished yet. It is also NOT mobile friendly but I'm working on that.
The top bar contains links to my Github, LinkedIn, Spotify, and a mailto link for quick communication. Once you've clicked around
and explored the site feel free to reach out with any thoughts/criticisms/feedback via social media or email!
